Soft Sidetone Generator
=======================

A Arduino-based CW sidetone generator and keying filter.

The sidetone is generated in software and converted to a analog signal via PWM and a low-pass RC-filter. \
Both the sidetone and the keying envelope is softened by a gaussian curve with 5 ms rise and fall time.

The end goal is a custom board/kit with a ATtiny MCU. In it's simplest configuration it shouldn't be much more \
complex than the common 555-timer based circuit practise oscillator but still deliver a smooth, clickless sine wave signal.

Features
--------

* Debounced key input.
* Square wave tone (Simple mode). The RC-filter + speaker make this tone pretty OK but it's still clicky.

Backlog
-------
* Sine wave tone using PWM (Advanced mode).
* Adjustable sidetone frequency 500-1000Hz.
* Gaussian wave envelope (Advanced mode).
* Simple record and replay.
* Keyer output with gausian envelope to help keep the transmitting bandwith down (sideband).

Circuit
-------

### Using an Arduino board:

Input and non-audio output:

 * LED attached from pin 4 to ground
 * Key attached from pin 2 to +5V
 * 10K resistor attached from pin 2 to ground
  
Low pass filter (692 Hz):

* 5K resistor attached from pin 3 (PWM) to output
* 0.047uF cap from output to ground
* output to amplifier

### Custom board

TBD

Build
-----

Requires the Arduino IDE installed in ARDUINODIR.

    export ARDUINODIR=/Users/daijo/Code/Arduino/
    export SERIALDEV=/dev/tty.usbserial-A6007ZuZ
    export BOARD=atmega328
    make
    make upload

For the ATtiny custom board/kit you also need the arduino-tiny additions found at <http://code.google.com/p/arduino-tiny/>.

    export BOARD=at2313at1
    export ARDUINOPORT=tiny
