Soft Sidetone Generator
=======================

A Arduino-based CW sidetone generator. The tone is generated in software and converted to a analog signal via PWM and a low-pass RC-filter.

The end goal is a custom board with a ATtiny MCU. In it's simplest configuration it shouldn't be much more complex than the common 555-timer based circuit but still deliver a smooth, clickless sine wave signal.

Features
--------------------

* Debounced key input.
* Square wave tone.

Backlog
-------
* Sine wave tone using PWM <http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc2542.pdf>.
* Adjustable frequency 500-1000Hz.
* Shaped wave like: <http://www.solorb.com/elect/hamcirc/sidetone/>.
* Record and replay.
* Keyer output.

Circuit
-------

### Using an Arduino board:

Input and non-audio output:

 * LED attached from pin 4 to ground
 * Key attached from pin 2 to +5V
 * 10K resistor attached from pin 2 to ground
  
Low pass filter (692 Hz):

* 5K resistor attached from pin 3 (PWM) to output
* 0.047uF cap from output to ground
* output to amplifier


### Custom board

TBD
